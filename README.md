EET Screensaver brings the AppleTV's wonderful screensavers to your Windows desktop. You can limit which videos to play, or randomly play them all. 
EET Screensaver seamlessly transitions between each video and can also display information like time, date, images, location, and sunrise/sunset times on top of the video.
Aerial can download videos for offline and smoother viewing and can play your own local videos.
